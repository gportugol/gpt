  Copyright:

    We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public
    domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source
    code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including
    the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.

    We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask
    that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean
    that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your
    programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
    acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
    etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output,
    please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask
    that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
    guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and
    expect to make other tools available as they are completed.
